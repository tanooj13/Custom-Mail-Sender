## Configuration

### Groq API
- The Groq API key and URL are configured in `email_utils.py`:
  ```python
  GROQ_API_KEY = 'your_groq_api_key_here'
  GROQ_API_URL = 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions'
  ```
- Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

### SMTP Settings
- The SMTP server for Gmail is used by default in `email_utils.py`:
  ```python
  smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
  smtp_port = 587
  ```
- Update these values if using a different email provider.
